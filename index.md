### Hi.

### My name is Jordy Schreuders

I am an independent software developer from The Netherlands that specializes in building medium to large scale web applications, primarily using [PHP](https://php.net) and the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) development framework.

Initially this website will mostly be a place where I'll share snippets of code and things I've learned during my day to day. Later on I intend to develop my writing and will be using this as a place to publish my thoughts and ideas on various topics of interest such as (but not limited to) software architecture, economics, philosophy and human psychology.

Looking for a way to support me or my work? Consider going through one of the referral links below:
