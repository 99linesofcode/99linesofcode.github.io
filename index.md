A collection of thoughts, ideas and code snippets I felt were worth sharing.

Starting off this will mostly be a place where I'll share boilerplate code and things I've learned during my day to day. In the near future I intend to do more writing on subjects such as philosophy, psychology, computer science and various other subject matter. To my and other people's amusement I'm sure.
