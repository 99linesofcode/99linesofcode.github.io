### About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Jordy. I'm originally from Eindhoven, a city in the southern, characteristically Burgundian part of the Netherlands. These days, I'm slow traveling around the world with my best friend and wife, Esther.

I am an endlessly curious and driven individual, guided by a deep commitment to equality, honesty, and intellectual growth. As a free thinker and generalist, I thrive on exploring new ideas and perspectives, challenging conventional systems, and seeking better, more equitable ways for people to live and work. I believe that systems and institutions should serve humanityâ€”not the other way around. They should empower people to live authentically, rather than forcing them into rigid molds.

My approach to life is deeply humanistic: I value diversity, respect, and individuality over conformity, and I prefer to take a bottom-up approach to solving problems, always with a healthy dose of skepticism toward authority. Perhaps this mindset was heavily influenced by the online hacker culture of the 90s that I grew up in? Looking back on them I donâ€™t see people breaking systems with malicious intent but rather as being driven by a need for understanding and an insatiable thirst for innovation â€” a deeply human trait that I greatly admire.

While I thrive on wrapping my head around challenging abstract concepts, grounding myself in nature keeps me sane. As a devoted hiker, I find peace and perspective while exploring the beautiful mountains and forests of our planet. My location-independent lifestyle allows me the freedom to do this, immersing myself in different cultures and ways of life along the way.

Iâ€™m driven by a sense of social responsibility to make a positive impact, and I strive to reflect this in both my personal and professional life. I reject repetitive, soul-draining labor and prefer to spend my time working on systems, technologies, and ideas that present solutions to the important issues of our time.
