### About Me

👋 Hi, I’m Jordy. I’m just a curious guy with a knack for taking things apart and building them back up. Born and raised in Eindhoven, in the southern, characteristically Burgundian part of the Netherlands.

Technology has been a constant in my life since I first discovered the Wild West that was the ‘90s internet. Even back then, I was fascinated by how it gave people access to information, ideas, and ways to connect that were never possible before. That curiosity and fascination hasn’t gone anywhere—it drives me everyday and keeps me tinkering with systems and ideas, asking questions like:  “How does this work?”, “How can it be improved?” and “How can we make it more accessible?”.

At my core, I believe that technology, systems—really, anything we create—should serve people, not trap them in rigid molds or meaningless processes. If something’s broken or holding people back, I lean toward fixing it, improving it, or, if necessary, tearing it down. Maybe that comes from the hacker culture I grew up in as a kid, where challenging systems wasn’t just the status quo, it was encouraged.

I’m also deeply humanistic in how I approach life. I get the most joy out of seeing and challenging diverse perspectives, hearing new stories, and figuring out what makes people tick. I’m skeptical of authority for its own sake, but I’m also optimistic about what can happen when people work together and build something from the ground up.

When I’m not tinkering with computers or building something tangible with my hands, you’ll probably find me outside. Hiking through a dense forest, climbing a mountain or camping near a natural lake. That’s my happy place. It’s where I process my thoughts, hit reset and remind myself that most of the things we stress about are, in all honestly, pretty small in the grand scheme of it all.

These days, my wife Esther and I live a location-independent life—a fancy way of saying I’ve traded a permanent address for a backpack which lets me explore the planet, meet new people, and experience different cultures. It keeps me on my toes and lets me look at life from an ever changing background. Exactly how I like it.

Work-wise, I’m driven by curiosity and a sense of purpose. I’m not into anything repetitive or soul-draining—I’d much rather spend my time solving new and meaningful problems, designing systems that make people's lives better, or thinking about technologies and how they can help tackle the big issues of our times. It’s not always glamorous work, it can be challenging and occasionally painful but it's a large part of who I am, captured into a beautiful and ever evolving profession.
